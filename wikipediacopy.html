      <p>
        this is some information on the headings above bla bla bla. Favoutir Notice  that  we  have  a  mix  of  semantic  and  regular  HTML,  to  both  organise  the  page  intothematic groups of tags, but also to mark-up the content of the page.  For example, each section,in a larger page, might have a set of heading, so regular HTML is still needed, even though weare now adding in these organisational,semantic, elements.  Try to pick out the various sections.Use this as the basis for building a few pages for a cookery site (changing as much as necessary).Make sure to include a few recipes so that you can consider how you might collate and organisethe ingredients list, the procedure, and the description of the resulting dish.
